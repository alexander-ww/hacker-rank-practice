## Post-Order Traversal

Complete the _postOrder_ function. It receives 1 parameter: a
pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in
the tree's post-order traversal as a single line of space-separated
values.

## Input Format

The first line provide the number of nodes in the binary tree.
The second line provides the nodes of the tree according to its structure.

## Constraints

1 <= Nodes in the tree <= 500

## Output Format

Print the tree's post-order traversal as a single line of space-separated values.
