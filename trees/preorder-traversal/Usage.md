Complete the _preOrder_ function, which has 1 parameter: a
pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in
the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated
values.

## Input Format

The user provides the size of the tree on the first line of input.
The user then provides the nodes on the second line of input.

## Constraints

1 <= nodes in the tree <= 500

## Output Format

Print the tree's preorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

## Sample Input
