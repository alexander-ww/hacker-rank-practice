# In-Order Traversal

In this challenge, you are required to implement in-order
traversal of a tree. Complete the _inOrder_ function, which
has 1 parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It
must print the values in the tree's in-order traversal as a
single line of space-separated values.

## Input Format

The user provides the size of the tree on the first line of input.
The user then provides the nodes on the second line of input.

## Constraints

1 <= _Nodes in the tree_ <= 500

## Output Format

Print the tree's in-order traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

## Sample Input

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    5
   / \
  3   6
   \
    4
```

```
6
1 2 5 3 4 6
```

## Sample Output

```
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

## Explanation

The tree's in-order traversal results in 1 2 3 4 5 6 as the required result.
