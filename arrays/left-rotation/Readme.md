# Left Rotation

## First Input Line
In order to run the left-rotation code, you will need to first 
enter two numbers. The first of those numbers will be the size 
of the array that is to be rotated and the second of those numbers
will be the number of rotations to perform. Once these two numbers
have been entered, you will then need to hit the return key.

## Second Input Line
Next, you will need to enter a line of space-separated numbers 
that represent values in the array of the size that you had
previous specified. Once these array values have been entered, 
you can then hit the return key.

## Result Output Line
The result of running the program will be a printed array of
values that is the left rotation of the original array of values.
