# Left Rotation Usage

## First Line
In order to run the left-rotation code, you will need to first 
enter two positive integers. The first of those positive integers
will be the size of the array that is to be rotated and the second
of those positive integers will be the number of rotations to perform.
Once these two positive integers have been entered, you will then need
to hit the return key.

## Second Line
Next, you will need to enter a line of space-separated integers 
that represent values in the array of the size that you had
previous specified. Once these array values have been entered, 
you can then hit the return key.

## Result
The result of running the program will be a printed array of
values that is the left rotation of the original array of values.

## Example
Below is an example of running the left-rotation program. As
previously described, the first line contains the size of the
array to rotate and the number of positions by which to rotate
left. The second line contains the array values. The third line
contains the output after performing the left rotation operation.

```
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
5 1 2 3 4
```
