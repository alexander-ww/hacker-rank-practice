# Print Elements Usage

## First Line
In order to run the print elements code, you will need to first
enter a single positive integer. This positive integer will be the
size of the linked list. Once this positive integer has been entered,
you will then need to hit the return key.

## Subsequent Lines
Next, you will need to enter a single value per line for each and
every single one of the entries in the linked list of the size you
have specified.

## Result
The result of running the program will be a line-by-line print of
the values of the linked list that should mirror the input that you
entered following your first input line.

## Example
Below is an example of running the print elements program. As
previously described, the first line contains the size of the linked
list to print. The subsequent lines then contain the values for the
nodes in the linked list, which are then followed by the printing of
those same values when performing the linked-list traversal.
