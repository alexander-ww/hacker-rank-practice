# Insert at Head Usage

## First Line
In order to run the insert at head code, you will need to first
enter a single positive integer. This positive integer will be the
size of the linked list. Once this positive integer has been entered,
you will then need to hit the return key.

## Subsequent Lines
Next, you will need to enter a single value per line for each and
every single one of the entries that you intend to add for the linked
list of the size you have specified.

## Result
The result of running the program will be a line-by-line print of
the values in the newly-produced linked list. The linked list that
is produced should be in the reverse order in which you had
entered the values in the lines following the first input line.

## Example
Below is an example of running the insert at head program. As
previously described, the first line contains the size of the linked
list to print. The subsequent lines then contain the values for the
nodes in the linked list, which are then followed by the printing of
those same values in reverse order when performing the linked
list traversal.
