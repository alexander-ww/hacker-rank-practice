# Reverse Doubly Linked

## First Line
In order to run the reverse doubly-linked list program, you will need
to first enter a single positive integer. This positive integer will be the
number of tests to run.

## Second Line
Next, you will need to provide a single positive integer
for the size of the doubly-linked list for the test instance.

## Subsequent Lines
Next, you will need to enter a single value per line for each and
every single one of the entries that are nodes in the doubly linked
list that will be reversed for the test instance. Once, the values for
a test instance have been added, go and add another second line
and the subsequent lines for subsequent test instances if there are
more than one test instance.

## Result
The result of running the program is a single-line 
print of the node values in the reversed linked list.

## Example
Below is an example of running the reverse 
doubly-linked list program for a single test instance.
