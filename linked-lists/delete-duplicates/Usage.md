# Delete Duplicates

## First Line
In order to run the delete duplicates program, you will need
to first enter a single positive integer. This positive integer
will be the number of tests to run.

## Second Line
Next, you will need to provide a single positive integer
for the size of the first singly-linked list for the test instance.

## Subsequent Lines
Next, you will need to enter a single value per line for each and
every single one of the entries that are nodes in the singly-linked
list in the test instance.

## Result
The result of running the program is a single-line 
print of the node values in the modified linked list.

## Example
Below is an example of running the delete
duplicates program for a single test instance.
