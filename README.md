# hacker-rank-practice
This GitHub repository provides my own solutions to practice problems 
from HackerRank in a variety of different programming languages.

## Running C++ Solutions
In order to run the C++ solutions, the _GNU C++_ compiler is required
along with the _make_ utility. Running _make_ in the directory of a
C++ solution will perform all of the necessary compiling and linking.
Running the code can then be performed by invoking the produced executable.

## Running Java Solutions
In order to run the Java solutions, a version of the Java Development
Kit (JDK) and its associated Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are required.
Once a JDK is installed, the _make_ utility can be used to compile the
the Java source code into Java byte code. Running the code can then be
performed by invoking the produced byte code for the main class with
the Java interpreter.

## Running Python Solutions
In order to run the Python solutions, a version of the Python 3.0.0+
interpreter is required. Simply invoking the Python script with the
Python interpreter will run the solution.
