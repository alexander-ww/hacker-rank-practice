# HackerRank Practice
This repository provides my own solutions to practice problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).
The solutions of mine are primarily written in the languages of C/C++, Java, and Python. The solved
problems are a combination of data structure questions and example questions for technical interviews.
While developing these solutions, I have focused on achieving the optimal asymptotic time complexity
and the optimal asymptotic space complexity. Information for the stated problem constraints has also
been considered.

## Running C/C++ Solutions

This section provides information for
running solutions written in C/C++.

#### Required Tools
- GNU C++ compiler
- GNU Make utility

#### Code Execution
1. Open a terminal window on your machine
2. Navigate to the directory with the source code and the _makefile_
3. Run the `make` command in the terminal window and hit the return key
4. Launch the produced executable by typing in `./EXECUTABLE`
5. Provide input in accordance with the _Usage.md_ file in the code directory.

## Running Java Solutions

This section provides information for
running solutions written in Java.

#### Required Tools
- Java JDK
