# HackerRank Practice
This repository provides my own solutions to practice problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).
The solutions of mine are primarily written in the languages of C/C++, Java, and Python. The solved
problems are a combination of data structure questions and example questions for technical interviews.

## Running C++ Solutions

##### Required Tools
- GNU C++ compiler
- GNU Make utility

##### Code Execution
1. Navigate to the directory with the _makefile_
2. Run the _make_ command in the terminal window
3. Run the produced executable

## Running Java Solutions
In order to run the Java solutions, a version of the Java Development
Kit (JDK) and its associated Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are required.
Once a JDK is installed, the _make_ utility can be used to compile the
the Java source code into Java byte code. Running the code can then be
performed by invoking the produced byte code for the main class with
the Java interpreter.

## Running Python Solutions
In order to run the Python solutions, a version of the Python 3.0.0+
interpreter is required. Simply invoking the Python script with the
Python interpreter will run the solution.
